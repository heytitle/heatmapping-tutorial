## Sprint 2 : 11/09/2017 - 25/09/2017
- [x] Travis CI + Unitests
- [x] Figure Generator Utils (save output to dirs that latex can use )
- [x] Train & Test model local
- [x] Simple network diagram ( v1 )
- [x] Run v1 several times
- [x] Next improvement...

#### Sprint Review
- Always log loss and training accuracy to make sure that the network is actually learning.
- MUST not softmax before softmax_entropy layer
- Always normalize input value. ie. for minist simply divide by 255
