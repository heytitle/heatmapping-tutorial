    "# Improvement of Guided Backprop  on R-LSTM\n",
    "Previously, when applying GB, gradient of sigmoid units were not controled. This results in poor performance of GB on R-LSTM. In particular, the percentage of GB was SA or slightly worse. In this version, I set gradient of sigmoids to be zero for GB. This gradient overridng seems to give much better results for GB. Below is the plot comparing between Deep and R-LSTM with the sigmoid gradient being overriden.\n",

    "# A better evaluation metric for measuring properly distributed relevance\n",
    "When inspecting experiment results, I found that there are some heatmaps where the right most digit/item in the majority group are primarily highlighted, while the other one barely has relevance assigned to. When such cases happen, **the percentage of relevance in data region** that we currently use to quantify the improvement is very close to 1, although the other digit/item is not highlighted. The figure below is one of such cases.\n",

    "\n",
    "As a result, I am thinking to slightly change the way we compute **the percentage**. More precisely, each block of digit/item  cannot have the percentage greater than $\\tau$. This new calculation will not let architectures that dominantly distribute relevance to only one region get too high percentage. Below is the figure comparing the adjusted percentage between Deep and R-LSTM with $\\tau=0.8$.\n",

    "# ConvDeep with Literal connections\n",
    "For the last part, there was a critical mistake in my implemenation of ConvDeep with literal connections, denoted as Conv$^+$Deep. After correcting the problems, it turns out that Conv$^+$Deep gives much worse result than ConvDeep.\n",
